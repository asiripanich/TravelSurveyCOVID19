# Travel survey resources

This repository holds the survey forms that we used to conduct a smartphone travel survey during the period of COVID-19 in Australia.

Inside the 'forms' folder, you will find the survey forms in PDF and XLSform formats. Only, `01_initial_selection_survey` that doesn't have a XLSform but a `qsf` Qualtrics survey form. However, it shouldn't be too diffucult to create a similar XLSform from it.

The table below contains links to the source codes of the open source tools we used to conduct this survey.
